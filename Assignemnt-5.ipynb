It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program.\n","\n","2) While in this language, the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine.\n","\n","3)There is only one step to get from source code to execution.\n","\n","4)While in this language, interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running.\n","\n","5)In this languages, all the debugging occurs at run-time.A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.\n","\n","6)This language example delivers relatively slower performance.\n","\n","7)Example of Interpreted language – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.\n","\n","**2) What is exception handling in Python**?\n","\n","**Ans:-** Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to respond to and manage runtime errors. It enables a program to continue execution or exit gracefully when an unexpected event occurs.\n","Here are some things to know about exception handling in Python:\n","\n","**1] Errors and exceptions**\n","An error is an event that interrupts the flow of a program, causing any further code to stop executing. An exception is the term for this error.\n","\n","**2] Try-Except statements**\n","A Try-Except statement is a code block that allows a program to take alternative actions if an error occurs. Python first attempts to execute the code in the try statement. If no exception occurs, the except statement is skipped.\n","\n","**3] Built-in exceptions**\n","Some examples of built-in exceptions in Python include:\n","\n","**TypeError:** This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.\n","for eg:-\n","\n","          x = 5\n","          y = \"hello\"\n","          z = x + y\n","\n","\n","Output:-\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","\n","  File \"7edfa469-9a3c-4e4d-98f3-5544e60bff4e.py\", line 4, in <module>\n","\n"," z = x + y\n","\n","TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n","\n","\n","\n","**NameError:** Raised when a variable does not exist .\n","\n","**ValueError:** This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.\n","for eg:-\n","\n","         amount = 10000\n","         if(amount > 2999)\n","         print(\"You are eligible to purchase Dsa Self Paced\")\n","\n","\n","\n","Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.\n","\n","**OSError:** Raised when a system related operation causes an error.\n","\n","**4] Exception-propagation mechanism**\n","When an exception is raised, the exception-propagation mechanism takes control. Python looks for a suitable exception handler, stopping the normal control flow of the program\n","\n","**3)  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** the purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n","\n","**Cleanup tasks**\n","The finally block is typically used for cleanup tasks and releasing resources that need to be performed no matter what.\n","\n","**Reliable and clean code execution**\n","The finally block is essential for any Python programmer aiming for reliable and clean code execution.\n","\n","**Ensures proper cleanup**\n","The finally block ensures proper cleanup of resources and consistent handling of situations where cleanup is necessary.\n","The finally block is used in try-except blocks. The try block lets you test a block of code for errors, the except block lets you handle the error, and the else block lets you execute code when there is no error.\n","\n","The finally block is executed when no matter if the try block raises an error or not.\n","\n","Before control is transferred out of the try-except-finally structure.\n","\n","**4)What is logging in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running. You can use logging to record information about errors, warnings, and other events that occur during program execution. And logging is a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your program.\n","\n","**Python Logging Levels**\n","There are five built-in levels of the log message.  \n","\n","**Debug:** These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n","\n","**Info:** These are used to confirm that things are working as expected.\n","\n","**Warning:** These are used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future.\n","\n","**Error:** This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n","\n","**Critical:** This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","\n","**There are several logger objects offered by the base Handler itself.**\n","\n","\n","**Logger.info(msg):** This will log a message with level INFO on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.warning(msg):** This will log a message with a level WARNING on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.error(msg):** This will log a message with level ERROR on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.critical(msg):** This will log a message with level CRITICAL on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.log(lvl,msg):** This will Log a message with integer level lvl on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.exception(msg):** This will log a message with level ERROR on this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.setLevel(lvl):** This function sets the threshold of this logger to lvl. This means that all the messages below this level will be ignored.\n","\n","**Logger.addFilter(filt):** This adds a specific filter fit into this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.removeFilter(filt):** This removes a specific filter fit into this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.filter(record):** This method applies the logger’s filter to the record provided and returns True if the record is to be processed. Else, it will return False.\n","\n","**Logger.addHandler(hdlr):** This adds a specific handler hdlr to this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.removeHandler(hdlr) :** This removes a specific handler hdlr into this logger.\n","\n","**Logger.hasHandlers():** This checks if the logger has any handler configured or not.\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","       import logging\n","       name = 'GFG'\n","       logging.error('%s raised an error', name)\n","\n","\n","output:-\n","\n","  ERROR:root:GFG raised an error\n","\n","\n","\n","**5) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n","\n","**Purpose:** The __del__ method is used to define the actions that should be performed before an object is destroyed. This can include releasing external resources such as files or database connections associated with the object.\n","\n","**Usage:** When Python's garbage collector identifies that an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, it schedules the __del__ method of that object to be called before reclaiming its memory.\n","\n","**Syntax:** The __del__ method is defined using the following syntax.\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","          class ClassName:\n","               def __del__(self):\n","               # cleanup code here\n","                 pass\n","\n","The __del__ method is automatically called by Python's garbage collector when an object’s reference count drops to zero.\n","\n","\n","\n","**6)What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** In Python, there are two ways to import modules or objects from modules: import statement and from statement. Both serve a similar purpose, but there are some differences between import and from statement in Python and how they work.\n","\n","The import statement is used to import a module or a module's attribute into the current namespace. It allows you to access the module's attributes by prefixing them with the module name. For example, to import the math module, you would use the statement import math. Then, to access the sqrt() function, you would use math.sqrt().\n","\n","Syntax of Import Module Statement:\n","\n","          import module_name\n","\n","\n","On the other hand, the from statement is used to import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. With the from statement, you can import only the attributes that you need, instead of the entire module. For example, to import just the sqrt() function from the math module, you would use the statement from math import sqrt. Then, you can use the sqrt() function directly in your code, without prefixing it with the module name.\n","\n","Syntax of From Import Statement\n","\n","\n","\n","         from module_name import name1, name2, ...\n","\n","\n","**There are some key differences between import and from statements in Python:**\n","\n","**Namespace pollution:** The import statement imports the entire module into the current namespace, which can lead to namespace pollution and naming conflicts. The from statement imports only the specified attributes, which can help to avoid these issues.\n","\n","**Code readability:** The import statement is more explicit and easier to read, as it shows where each attribute comes from. The from statement can make code harder to read, as it doesn't show the module name.\n","\n","**Performance:** The import statement is generally faster than the from statement, as it only needs to import the module once. The from statement may need to import the same attributes multiple times, which can be slower.\n","\n","**Aliasing:** The import statement allows you to alias a module or a module's attribute, which can make the code more readable and concise. For example, you can use the statement import math as m to alias the math module to m. The from statement doesn't allow you to alias a module or a module's attribute.\n","\n","**Attribute access:** The import statement requires you to access the module's attributes using the dot notation, which can be cumbersome if the module name is long. The from statement allows you to access the imported attributes directly, without using the dot notation.\n","\n","**Importing subpackages:** The import statement allows you to import subpackages of a module using dot notation, which can make it easier to organize and modularize your code. The from statement doesn't allow you to import subpackages directly.\n","\n","**Name clashes:** The import statement allows you to import multiple modules or attributes with the same name, as long as they are in different namespaces. The from statement doesn't allow you to do this, as it only imports the specified attributes into the current namespace.\n","\n","**Dynamic imports:** The import statement allows you to import modules dynamically at runtime, which can make your code more flexible and modular. The from statement doesn't allow you to do this, as it requires you to specify the attributes to import at compile time.\n","\n","\n","\n","**7)How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** The code that can throw any of several different exceptions, and one needs to account for all of the potential exceptions that could be raised without creating duplicate code or long, meandering code passages.\n","\n","If we can handle different exceptions all using a single block of code, they can be grouped together in a tuple as shown in the code given below :\n","\n","**for eg:-#1**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","    =try:\n","         client_obj.get_url(url)\n","    except (URLError, ValueError, SocketTimeout):\n","        client_obj.remove_url(url)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The remove_url() method will be called if any of the listed exceptions occurs. If, on the other hand, if one of the exceptions has to be handled differently, then put it into its own except clause as shown in the code given below :\n","\n","**eg #2 :-**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","    try:\n","       client_obj.get_url(url)\n","    except (URLError, ValueError):\n","       client_obj.remove_url(url)\n","    except SocketTimeout:\n","       client_obj.handle_url_timeout(url)\n","\n","\n","Many exceptions are grouped into an inheritance hierarchy. For such exceptions, all of the exceptions can be caught by simply specifying a base class. For example, instead of writing code as shown in the code given below –\n","\n","**eg #3 :-**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","     try:\n","         f = open(filename)\n","     except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError):\n","\n","\n","\n","Except statement can be re-written as in the code given below. This works because OSError is a base class that’s common to both the FileNotFoundError and PermissionError exceptions.\n","\n","**eg #4 :-**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","     try:\n","        f = open(filename)\n","        except OSError:\n","\n","\n","\n","**8) What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. Observe the following code example on how the use of with statement makes code cleaner.the with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file. A function or class that supports the with statement is known as a context manager.\n","\n","**Syntax**\n","\n","     # using with statement\n","    with open('file_path', 'w') as file:\n","    file.write('hello world !')\n","\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","      # a simple file writer object\n","\n","    class MessageWriter(object):\n","    def __init__(self, file_name):\n","        self.file_name = file_name\n","    \n","    def __enter__(self):\n","        self.file = open(self.file_name, 'w')\n","        return self.file\n","\n","    def __exit__(self, *args):\n","        self.file.close()\n","\n","     # using with statement with MessageWriter\n","\n","       with MessageWriter('my_file.txt') as xfile:\n","       xfile.write('hello world')\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**9)What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n","\n","**Ans:-**\n","\n","**Multithreading**\n","\n","Involves creating multiple threads within a single process, which run independently but share the process's resources. Multithreading is good for I/O bound tasks.It is a system in which multiple threads are created of a process for increasing the computing speed of the system. In multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously and process creation in multithreading is done according to economical.\n","\n","**Advantages**\n","\n","1]More efficient than multiprocessing for tasks within a single process.\n","\n","2]Threads share a common address space, which is memory-efficient.\n","\n","**Disadvantages**\n","\n","1]Not classified into categories like multiprocessing.\n","\n","2]Thread creation is economical but can lead to synchronization issues.\n","\n","**Multiprocessing**\n","Involves running multiple processes, each with its own dedicated resources, on two or more central processing units (CPUs). Multiprocessing is good for CPU bound tasks.is a system that has more than one or two processors. In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added to increase the computing speed of the system. Because of Multiprocessing, There are many processes are executed simultaneously. Explore more about similar topics. Multiprocessing is classified into two categories:\n","\n","1.

You can use logging to record information about errors, warnings, and other events that occur during program execution. And logging is a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your program.\n","\n","**Logging in a python have many advantages,:-**\n","\n","**Debugging**\n","\n","Logging can help you identify and fix bugs by providing information about how your application behaves under different circumstances.\n","\n","**Improving user experience**\n","\n","Logs can help you understand how users interact with your application, which can help you improve their experience.\n","\n","**Preventing failures**\n","\n","Logs can help you identify the root cause of failures and prevent them from happening again.\n","\n","**Monitoring applications**\n","\n","Logs can help you monitor the behavior of your applications in production.\n","\n","**Security**\n","\n","Logging can help improve the security of your application by reducing its attack surface and improving detection and response times.\n","\n","**Compliance**\n","\n","Logging can help you ensure that your logs are created appropriately and that you comply with rules like GDPR.\n","\n","**Data protection**\n","\n","You may need to keep logs for extended periods to comply with data protection laws.\n","\n","**Performance and activity analysis**\n","\n","You may need to keep logs for extended periods to perform long-term analysis of your application's performance and activity.\n","\n","Logging is a way of tracking events that happen when software runs. It can be important for software development, debugging, and running.\n","\n","\n","**11)What is memory management in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-**  Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program.\n","\n","**1] Garbage collection**\n","\n"," In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.\n","Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects.\n","\n","**2] Automatic**\n","\n","Python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, unlike other programming languages like C or Rust where the programmer is responsible for manually managing memory\n","Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory\n","\n","**3] Reference counting**\n","\n","Reference counting works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system. When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated.\n","For example, Let’s suppose there are two or more variables that have the same value, so, what Python virtual machine does is, rather than creating another object of the same value in the private heap, it actually makes the second variable point to that originally existing value in the private heap. Therefore, in the case of classes, having a number of references may occupy a large amount of space in the memory, in such a case referencing counting is highly beneficial to preserve the memory to be available for other objects\n","\n","**4] Object-specific allocators**\n","\n","Python's memory manager delegates some work to object-specific allocators, which implement memory management policies for each object type. For example, integer objects are managed differently than strings, tuples, or dictionaries.\n","\n","\n","**12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-**\n","The basic steps in exception handling in Python are to use the try, except, and finally blocks:\n","\n","**Try block:** Tests code where exceptions are likely to occur.\n","\n","**Except block:** Handles exceptions by executing code when an exception occurs in the try block. You can specify the type of exception to catch.\n","\n","**Finally block:** Ensures that certain actions are always performed, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n","\n","Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program.\n","\n","**Different types of exceptions in python:**\n","\n","In Python, there are several built-in Python exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. Here are some of the most common types of exceptions in Python:\n","\n","**SyntaxError:** This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.\n","\n","**TypeError:** This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.\n","NameError: This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.\n","\n","**IndexError:** This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.\n","\n","**KeyError:** This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.\n","\n","**ValueError:** This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.\n","\n","**AttributeError:** This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.\n","\n","**IOError:** This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.\n","ZeroDivisionError: This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.\n","\n","**ImportError:** This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.\n","\n","\n","**13) Why is memory management important in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Memory management is important in Python because it helps make programs more efficient and improves the performance of the machine they run on:\n","\n","**Automatic memory management**\n","\n","Python automatically allocates and deallocates memory, so you don't have to do it manually. This is different from other programming languages, like C/C++, where you have to manually allocate and deallocate memory.\n","\n","**Memory-efficient code**\n","\n","Python's memory management helps you write code that's more efficient with memory. This means you can minimize the demand on other system resources and increase processing speeds.\n","\n","**Garbage collection**\n","\n","Python's garbage collector automatically frees memory from objects that are no longer being used. This helps prevent memory leaks, which can cause programs to operate slower.\n","\n","**Fine-tuning**\n","\n","You can fine-tune Python's garbage collector to optimize performance and memory usage. For example, you can disable garbage collection in performance-critical sections of code.\n","\n","\n","**14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Try and Except statement is used to handle these errors within our code in Python. The try block is used to check some code for errors i.e the code inside the try block will execute when there is no error in the program. Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block.\n","\n"," Syntax:-\n","\n","     try:\n","    # Some Code\n","     except:\n","    # Executed if error in the\n","    # try block\n","\n","\n","\n","How try() works?\n","\n","\n","1]First, the try clause is executed i.e. the code between try.\n","\n","2]If there is no exception, then only the try clause will run, except clause is finished.\n","\n","3]If any exception occurs, the try clause will be skipped and except clause will run.\n","\n","4]If any exception occurs, but the except clause within the code doesn’t handle it, it is passed on to the outer try statements.\n","\n","5]If the exception is left unhandled, then the execution stops.\n","\n","6]A try statement can have more than one except clause\n","\n","\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","\n","        \n","    # working of try()\n","        def divide(x, y):\n","    try:\n","        # Floor Division : Gives only Fractional Part as Answer\n","        result = x // y\n","        print(\"Yeah !

Your answer is : 1\n","\n","\n","\n","**15)How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** garbage collection system automatically manages memory by detecting and removing objects that are no longer in use. It uses a combination of mechanisms to do this, including:\n","\n","**Reference counting**\n","\n","This is the primary garbage collection mechanism in Python. It keeps track of how many references an object has. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted.\n","\n","**Generational garbage collection**\n","\n","This method segregates objects into three generations: Generation 0, Generation 1, and Generation 2. New objects start in Generation 0, and objects that survive a collection are moved to the next generation.\n","\n","**Tracing garbage collection**\n","\n","This method is used for objects that cannot be handled by reference counting or generational garbage collection.\n","\n","Other features of Python's garbage collection system include:\n","\n","**Weak references:** These allow an object to be referenced without preventing it from being garbage collected.\n","\n","**Finalizers and destructors:** Developers can define these for objects.\n","\n","**Garbage collection tuning:** Python provides options to customize the garbage collector for a program's specific needs.\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","         # loading gc\n","       import gc\n","\n","        # get the current collection\n","         # thresholds as a tuple\n","        print(\"Garbage collection thresholds:\",\n","\t\t\t\t\tgc.get_threshold())\n","          \n","\n","\n","Output:- Garbage collection thresholds: (700, 10, 10)\n","\n","\n","**16)What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n","\n","**Ans:-**\n","The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.The ELSE statement specifies that alternate processing is to take place when the conditions of the matching IF statement are not satisfied. The ELSE statement has no parameters. The ELSE statement must be column-aligned with the matching IF statement.\n","You can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:\n","\n","for eg:-\n","\n","    try:\n","          print(\"Hello\")\n","    except:\n","          print(\"Something went wrong\")\n","    else:\n","          print(\"Nothing went wrong\")\n","\n","\n","\n","**17) What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** There are two main types of logging in Python, and those are class-based logging and function-based logging. Class-based logging is the most common type of logging in Python. It allows you to define a class representing a logger and then instantiate it to create a logger object.The specific log levels available to you may defer depending on the programming language, logging framework, or service in use. However, in most cases, you can expect to encounter levels such as FATAL , ERROR , WARN , INFO , DEBUG , and TRACE .\n","\n","The common logging levels in Python are:\n","\n","**DEBUG**\n","\n","The least threatening level, providing detailed information that's useful for diagnosing issues\n","\n","**INFO**\n","\n","A confirmation that things are working as expected, such as when the program starts or stops\n","\n","**WARNING**\n","\n","An indication that something unexpected happened or could happen soon\n","\n","**ERROR**\n","\n","A more serious problem that has prevented the software from performing some functions\n","\n","**CRITICAL**\n","\n","A severe error indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running\n","\n","**18)What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** A start method is a technique to start the child process in Python, There are 3 start methods\n","\n","**Fork:**\n","\n"," creates a copy from the existing process (resources used or altered by a parent will be referred by the child)\n","\n","**Spawn:**\n","\n"," creates the new process\n","\n","**Forkserver:**\n","\n"," new process from which future forked processes will be copied. (provides isolation and efficiency)\n","\n","\n","**Fork**\n","\n","This fork method works on creating the exact clone or copy of the parent process. i.e resources utilised or altered by the parent process will be accessed by the child.\n","\n","For Example:\n","If you declare a global variable num and set its value to 10, then modify the value of this variable within the parent process before creating a child process. The child process after being forked, will inherit the updated value of num from the parent. In simpler terms, the child process receives a copy of the existing process, including any changes made on the resources in the fork method.\n","\n","Explanation\n","\n","The script initializes \"num\" as 10 globally, accessible to both the main and child processes. Main process updates it to 20, but child process inherits the modified value 20. The child process prints 20, increments it to 21. In the script showcased, the 'fork' method is used to create child processes that inherit a snapshot of the parent process's memory, including variable values. However, changes made to shared variables within child processes don't impact the parent process.\n","\n","For eg:-\n","\n","      import multiprocessing\n","\n","      # initialize the value\n","      num = 10\n","    def childprocess():\n","  \n","    # refer to the global variable\n","    global num  \n","    print(f&quot;In child process before update: {num}&quot;)\n","\n","    #updating num value\n","    num+= 1\n","\n","    print(f&quot;In child process after update: {num}&quot;)\n","\n","\n","    def mainprocess():\n","\n","    # refer to the global variable\n","    global num\n","    print(f&quot;In parent process before update {num}&quot;)\n","\n","    #updating num value\n","    num = 20\n","\n","    # execution logic\n","    print(f&quot;In parent process after update: {num}&quot;)\n","    process = multiprocessing.Process(target = childprocess)\n","    process.start()\n","    process.join()\n","    print(f&quot;At the end the vaule is: {num}&quot;)\n","\n","    if __name__ == '__main__':\n","  \n","    # setting start method as fork\n","    multiprocessing.set_start_method('fork')\n","    print(multiprocessing.get_start_method())\n","    mainprocess()\n","\n","\n","    \n","**19) What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** At some point in your Python coding journey, you learn that you should use a context manager to open files. Python context managers make it easy to close your files once you’re done with them:\n","\n","    ith open(\"hello.txt\", mode=\"w\") as file:\n","    file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","The with statement initiates a context manager. In this example, the context manager opens the file hello.txt and manages the file resource as long as the context is active. In general, all the code in the indented block depends on the file object being open. Once the indented block either ends or raises an exception, then the file will close.\n","\n","If you’re not using a context manager or you’re working in a different language, then you might explicitly close files with the try … finally approach:\n","\n","    try:\n","    file = open(\"hello.txt\", mode=\"w\")\n","    file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n","    finally:\n","    file.close()\n","\n","    Performing write operations for each command can be expensive. For this reason, the Python default is to use a buffer that collects write operations. When the buffer gets full, or when the file is closed explicitly, the buffer is flushed, and the write operation is complete.\n","\n","Python works hard to clean up after itself. In most cases, it’ll proactively flush and close files by itself:\n","\n","        # write_hello.py\n","\n","       file = open(\"hello.txt\", mode=\"w\")\n","       file.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n","\n"," When running this code, the operating system creates the file. The operating system also writes the content even though you never actually flush or close the file in the code. This flushing and closing are taken care of by a cleanup routine that Python will perform at the end of execution.\n","\n","Sometimes exits aren’t so controlled, though, and a crash can end up bypassing this cleanup:\n","\n","      # crash_hello.py\n","\n","      mport os\n","\n","      file = open(\"crash.txt\", mode=\"w\")\n","      file.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n","       os._exit(1)\n","\n","\n","It is important to close files in Python. Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data. The best defense is always to open files with a context manager.\n","\n","\n","\n","**20) What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** In Python, the read() method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the readline() method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream. The read() method will read the entire content of the file or stream if no argument is provided, returning a string. On the other hand, the readline() method reads a single line up to the newline character (`\\n`) and returns it as a string. If there are no more lines to read, it will return an empty string. It's important to note that using read() can load the entire file into memory, which might not be efficient for large files, while readline() is suitable for reading a file line by line.\n","\n","\n","\n","1) - The read() method in Python is used to read a specific number of characters from a file or input stream, while the readline() method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream.\n","\n","2) The read() method reads the entire content of the file or input stream if no size is specified, while the readline() method reads from the current position until it encounters a newline character.\n","\n","3) The read() method can be used to read binary data or text from a file, while the readline() method is typically used for reading lines of text.\n","\n","4) When using read(), you need to specify the number of characters you want to read, while readline() automatically reads until a newline character is encountered.\n","\n","5) Both read() and readline() can be used to read from files, stdin, or any other input stream in Python.\n","\n","6) The read() method returns a string or bytes object, depending on whether the file is opened in text or binary mode, while readline() returns a string object containing the line read from the file.\n","\n","7) readline() is particularly useful when processing text files line by line, while read() is more flexible for reading specific amounts of data at once.\n","\n","8) It is important to close the file after using read() or readline() to release system resources and avoid memory leaks.\n","\n","9) Both methods can be called multiple times to read further content from the file or stream until the end is reached.\n","\n","\n","**21)What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running. You can use logging to record information about errors, warnings, and other events that occur during program execution. And logging is a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your program.\n","\n","**Python Logging Levels**\n","\n","There are five built-in levels of the log message.  \n","\n","**Debug:**\n","\n","These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n","\n","**Info:**\n","\n"," These are used to confirm that things are working as expected\n","\n","**Warning:**\n","\n"," These are used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future\n","\n","**Error:**\n","\n"," This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function\n","\n","**Critical:**\n","\n"," This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running\n","\n"," for eg:-\n","\n","            # importing module\n","          import logging\n","\n","          # Create and configure logger\n","          logging.basicConfig(filename=\"newfile.log\",\n","                              format='%(asctime)s %(message)s',\n","                              filemode='w')\n","\n","          # Creating an object\n","          logger = logging.getLogger()\n","\n","          # Setting the threshold of logger to DEBUG\n","          logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n","\n","          # Test messages\n","          logger.debug(\"Harmless debug Message\")\n","          logger.info(\"Just an information\")\n","          logger.warning(\"Its a Warning\")\n","          logger.error(\"Did you

Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** onr challenges with memory management in Python include:\n","\n","**Slower program runtimes**\n","\n","Python may hold freed memory in the interpreter instead of freeing it up for the operating system.\n","\n","**Memory leaks**\n","\n","Memory leaks can occur if references to objects are not released properly, or if circular references are created and not caught by the garbage collector.\n","\n","**Less manual customizability**\n","\n","Python doesn't offer the same level of manual customizability as other programming languages.\n","\n","Python uses a built-in garbage collector to automatically manage memory. The garbage collector uses a combination of reference counting and generational garbage collection to identify and release unused resources:\n","\n","**Reference counting**\n","\n","Keeps track of the number of references to each object in Python. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it's eligible for garbage collection.\n","\n","**Generational garbage collection**\n","\n","Categorizes objects into three generations, each with a threshold value. The garbage collector is triggered when the number of objects in a generation exceeds its threshold value.\n","\n","\n","Understanding Memory allocation is important to any software developer as writing efficient code means writing a memory-efficient code. Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program. In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.\n","\n","**Garbage Collection**\n","\n","Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects.\n","Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory\n","\n","\n","**Reference Counting**\n","\n","Reference counting works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system. When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated.\n","\n","For example, Let’s suppose there are two or more variables that have the same value, so, what Python virtual machine does is, rather than creating another object of the same value in the private heap, it actually makes the second variable point to that originally existing value in the private heap. Therefore, in the case of classes, having a number of references may occupy a large amount of space in the memory, in such a case referencing counting is highly beneficial to preserve the memory to be available for other objects\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","            x = 10\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**24)How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Python Raise Keyword\n","Python raise Keyword is used to raise exceptions or errors. The raise keyword raises an error and stops the control flow of the program. It is used to bring up the current exception in an exception handler so that it can be handled further up the call stack.\n","\n","Python Raise Syntax:-\n","\n","    raise  {name_of_ the_ exception_class}\n","\n","\n","The basic way to raise an error is:\n","\n","\n","      raise Exception(“user text”)\n","\n","\n","Checking whether an integer is odd or even\n","In the below code, we check if an integer is even or odd. if the integer is odd an exception is raised.  a  is a variable to which we assigned a number 5, as a is odd, then if loop checks if it’s an odd integer, if it’s an odd integer then an error is raised.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","            a = 5\n","            \n","            if a % 2 != 0:\n","                raise Exception(\"The number shouldn't be an odd integer\")\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Checking Errror Type\n","We can check the type of error which have occurred during the execution of our code. The error can be a ‘ValueError’ or a ‘ZeroDivisionError’ or some other type of error.\n","\n","\n","          Syntax: raise TypeError\n","\n","\n","Checking the error type\n","In the below code, we tried changing the string ‘apple’  assigned to s to integer and wrote a try-except clause to raise the ValueError. The raise error keyword raises a value error with the message “String can’t be changed into an integer”.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","        s = 'apple'\n","        \n","        try:\n","            num = int(s)\n","        except ValueError:\n","            raise ValueError(\"String can't be changed into integer\")\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Raising an exception Without Specifying Exception Class\n","When we use the raise keyword, there’s no compulsion to give an exception class along with it. When we do not give any exception class name with the raise keyword, it reraises the exception that last occurred.\n","\n","\n","\n","**25) Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n","\n","**Ans:-** Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows multiple tasks to execute seemingly simultaneously, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of an application by utilizing the available CPU cores efficiently, especially when dealing with tasks that involve waiting for input/output operations, like network requests or disk access, where a single thread could otherwise be idle while waiting.\n","Key reasons to use multithreading:\n","\n","**Better resource utilization:**\n","\n","By dividing tasks into multiple threads, a program can keep the CPU busy even when waiting for data from other sources, maximizing system resource utilization.\n","\n","**Enhanced responsiveness:**\n","\n","When a long-running task is handled in a separate thread, the main application thread remains responsive to user interactions.\n","\n","**Scalability:**\n","\n","Multithreading allows applications to take advantage of multi-core processors, distributing tasks across multiple cores for improved performance as the workload increases.\n","\n","**Concurrent operations:**\n","\n","In applications that require handling multiple events or requests simultaneously, like a web server, multithreading is crucial for efficiently managing each request independently.\n","\n","Examples of applications where multithreading is beneficial:\n","\n","**Graphic user interfaces (GUIs):**\n","\n","Keeping the UI responsive while performing background operations like data processing.\n","\n","**Network applications:**\n","\n","Handling multiple network connections concurrently, like a web server or chat application.\n","\n","**Media players:**\n","\n","Decoding audio and video streams simultaneously while updating the playback interface.\n","\n","**Games:**\n","\n","Simulating complex physics and rendering graphics in parallel for smooth gameplay.\n","\n","Important considerations when using multithreading:\n","\n","**Synchronization issues:**\n","\n"," Proper synchronization mechanisms are necessary to manage shared data between threads to prevent race conditions and data corruption.\n","\n","\n","**Thread management overhead:**\n","\n"," Creating and managing too many threads can introduce performance overhead.\n","\n","\n","**Complexity:**\n","\n"," Designing and debugging multithreaded applications can be more complex than single-threaded applications"],"metadata":{"id":"sF_9Wpbg0pIW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#***Practical Questions:-***"],"metadata":{"id":"D11nEhcz09Pg"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"metadata":{"id":"jvZTrXtdzIes","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735321796569,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":627,"user":{"displayName":"LISHA","userId":"10623773048070316025"}},"outputId":"0711938b-e69f-4d12-8322-d8c1be9911cd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Data written to 'my_output_file.txt' successfully.\n"]}],"source":["#1) How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it?\n","# Define the file path\n","file_path = \"my_output_file.txt\"\n","\n","# Open the file in write mode ('w')\n","# If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n","# If it exists, its contents will be overwritten.\n","with open(file_path, 'w') as file:\n","    #
